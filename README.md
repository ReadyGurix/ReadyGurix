# Hi! I'm @ReadyGurix

I'm a **junior software developer** and student in **Systems Administration in Networking and Cybersecurity (VET/Higher Technician)**.
I’m currently learning and improving my knowledge about system security, hardware architecture, and programming languages used in modern environments.

## 💻 About Me

* I’m really interested in **coding, computer hardware, AI technologies**, and **Unix-based operating systems**.
* **Currently learning:** Python and JavaScript.
* **Planning to explore:** Java and C++.
* I like to understand how things actually work, not just use them — always trying to learn new things and get better at what I do.

## Collaboration

I’m still starting out in the tech world, but I’m looking forward to **participating in real-world software and security projects**.
If I make any mistakes, I appreciate any feedback - that’s how I’ll keep improving.
Learning, testing, breaking, and fixing things is all part of the process.

Feel free to reach out or share any tips, advice, or project ideas!
I’m always open to learning from others and connecting with people in the community.
