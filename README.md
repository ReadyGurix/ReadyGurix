# 👋 Hi there! I'm @ReadyGurix

I'm a **junior software developer** and student in **Systems Administration in Networking and Cybersecurity (VET/Higher Technician)**.
I’m currently learning and improving my knowledge about system security, hardware architecture, and programming languages used in modern environments.

## 💻 About Me

* 🎯 I’m really interested in **coding, computer hardware, AI technologies**, and **Unix-based operating systems**.
* 📚 **Currently learning:** Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* 🚀 **Planning to explore:** Java, C++, and Dart.
* 🤓 I like to understand how things actually work, not just use them — always trying to learn new things and get better at what I do.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m still starting out in the tech world, but I’m looking forward to **participating in real-world software and security projects**.
If I make any mistakes, I appreciate any feedback — that’s how I’ll keep improving.
Learning, testing, breaking, and fixing things is all part of the process. 🙌
